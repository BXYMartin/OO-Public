## How To Check My Result?
You can watch this repo in case of anything changes. It will inform you by email (if any) ASAP.

For those who invoked **runtime error**, which is more critical, they will show up both in github issue page and on the website.

For those who raised **conflict error**, which is relatively hard to determine the correctness of the output, they will only be posted on [Github Pages](https://bxymartin.github.io/OO-Public/).

Make sure you identify all your errors occurred during the public test and manually confirm your bug fixed by clicking the **"Error Unresolved"** button in the website, it will turn green, Horray!

## Wanna Contribute Your Test Cases?
Simply fork this repo, add `*.mdj` files to `./test_mdj` and then create a merge request, your file will be in use in the next evaluation.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to all my classmates who made this public test possible by providing their valuable test cases and runnable jars.

The submodule of this repo is held on another repo [OO-Posts](https://github.com/Catherine9811/OO-Posts) with limited permissions, special thanks to my girlfriend for providing an account.

Part of the javascript used to communicate with Github API v3 is modified based on [github-js](https://github.com/akshaykumar6/github-js), with additional support for commit and remove of single post files, or check the existance of a file.

This Website is modified based on **HuxBlog Boilerplate**.

If you like Hux Blog, Please star **huxpro.github.io** repo!

## Developments
The autotest judge system can interact with github repos as well as gist (sadly not available currently) using `github.js` in `docs/js` folder. Also, included an encryption script to avoid the detection of the Github bots.
